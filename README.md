# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# To run the weather application locally, follow these steps:
 1.Clone the Repository:
 `git clone <(https://github.com/vikeshub/Weather-App.git)>`

 2.Navigate to the Project Directory:
 `cd weather-app`

3.Run the Application:
 `npm start`

# Approach and Technologies Used
React: The application is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Open Weather API: The weather data is fetched from the Open Weather API using a unique API key.
Dark/Light Mode Toggle: Implemented a toggle button to switch between dark and light modes for the application.

# Known Issues or Limitations
API Key Security: Ensure that the API key is kept secure and not exposed publicly, especially when deploying the application.
